# Reverse-Engineering-Code

I have reversed engineered the starter code provided and create a tutorial for the code.

```
AS A developer

I WANT a walk-through of the codebase

SO THAT I can use it as a starting point for a new project
```

I have read through the `Develop` folder and inspected the code to get an understanding of each file's responsibility. Then, in a Google Doc, I wrote a tutorial explaining *every* file and its purpose. I also included the files that are dependant on other files.

At the end of the tutorial, I also included instructions for how one could now add changes to this project.

Following the [common templates for user stories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story#Common_templates), I have framed this challenge as follows:


## Business Context

When joining a new team, I will be expected to inspect a lot of code that i've never seen before. Rather than having a team member explain every line for me, the best practice will be me dissecting the code, saving any questions for a member of your team.
